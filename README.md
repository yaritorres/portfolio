This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

I have also deployed to Vercel recently!

Feel free to visit the link found in the 'About' section and tell me what you think! 

I'll update as I find new ways to display the information and whenever I feel a change is needed.
